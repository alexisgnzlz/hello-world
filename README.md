# hello-world
This is a repository made to learn how to use github so don't pay attention to it.

Hi everyone my name is Alexis Gonz√°lez, I'm a Telecommunications Engineering student at Simon Bolivar's University. My interest are programming, game and web development and networks. By the time I'm writing this I have a lot of experience programming in C and trying to learn more about object oriented programming (C++, Java, Javascript, processing, p5.js and of course Android), maybe a little bit of haskell, I also need to improve my html, css an javascript skills and I'm trying to learn as hard as I can how to program games (Yeah! I know it sounds a lot of work to do but I'm willing to do my best). Rigth now I just have Space Invaders and Pong already programmed in processing because I wanted to use a wrapper for box2d called Fisica (I'll share them in the near future).

Well I think that's it for the moment. Thanks for reading.
